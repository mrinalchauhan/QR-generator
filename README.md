This application is designed to dynamically generate QR codes that encode information like URLs, text, or other data. It consists of:

Frontend (HTML + CSS):-

HTML: Provides a simple user interface where users can:
Enter data (text, URLs, etc.) into a form input field.
Click a button to generate a QR code.
View the generated QR code displayed on the screen.

CSS: Handles the styling of the application to make the interface user-friendly, including:
Layouts for the input field, button, and QR code display area.
Responsive design for mobile and desktop users.



Backend (Node.js):-

Purpose:
The backend processes the data sent from the frontend and generates the QR code using a Node.js library, such as qrcode.
Serves the generated QR code as an image or data URI to the frontend.

Key Features:
API Endpoint: Accepts data (e.g., a URL or text) from the frontend via an HTTP POST request.

QR Code Generation:
Uses the qrcode or a similar Node.js package to generate the QR code dynamically.
Returns the QR code to the frontend as an image or base64 string.

Error Handling:
Validates the input data to ensure it's not empty or invalid.
Responds with appropriate error messages for incorrect inputs.

Dependencies:
express: To handle HTTP requests and serve endpoints.
qrcode: To generate QR codes.
Optionally, cors and body-parser for cross-origin requests and JSON parsing.
